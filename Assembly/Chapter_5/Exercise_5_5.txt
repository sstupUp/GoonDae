Q: You are writing a function and you decided to use registers r4 and r5 within the function. Your function will not call any other functions; it is self-contained. Modify the following skeleton structure to ensure that r4 and r5 can be used within the function and are restored to comply with the ARM standards, but without unnecessary memory accesses.
   myfunc: stmfd sp!,{lr}
   	   	...
   		...
	   @ function statements
	        ...
		...
	   ldmfd sp!,{lr}

A:
   myfunc: stmfd sp!, {lr}
   	   stmfd sp!, {r4, r5}
	   	 ...
		 ...
	   @ function statements
	     	 ...
		 ...
	   ldmfd sp!, {r4, r5}
	   ldmfd sp!, {lr}
